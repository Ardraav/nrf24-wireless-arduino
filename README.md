# nrf24-wireless-arduino
This project allows wireless text communication between multiple users without the need for internet. It uses Arduino Nano boards with NRF24L01+ modules to create a private chat room over a 2.4 GHz RF channel. Messages are sent and received through a custom interface built in Processing. Up to six devices can join the chat network simultaneously.
